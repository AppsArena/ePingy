<h2>What is ePingy?</h2>
<p>ePingy is a simple mobile app that tries to ease the way employees communicate with in a corporate, just that the participants must be in the same WIFI network. So we go with a tagline <i>“Only Tapping, NO Typing”
</i>
</p>
<h2>What is ePingy NOT?</h2>

ePingy is NOT another CHAT APP, like the “whats app” or any other. 

<h2>ePingy is simple</h2>

We identified very common things that demand employee communication like:

<ul>
<li>	Call for a coffee break</li>
<li>	Call in a person for a quick discussion to others desk</li>
<li>	Call in someone who forgot to attend a scheduled meeting</li>
</ul>

And converted them to buttons, so that, there is no need to type a message. 

<h2>NO concept of adding contacts</h2>

ePingy lists every mobile installed with ePingy to every other user, this means, there is no need to add contacts

<h2>ePingy can be customized</h2>

ePingy allows user to customize more buttons to speed up user communication

<h2>What more can be added?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Refine User Discovery</li>
<li>Creation of groups</li>
<li>Plans to make it work for businesses, outside corporates, like coffee shops etc. </li>
<li>Creation of channels</li>
<li>ePingy for IOS and Windows</li>
<li>ePingy for desktops/mac</li>
<li>ePingy over Bluetooth</li>
<li>Any other ideas are welcome too!!</li>
</ul>
